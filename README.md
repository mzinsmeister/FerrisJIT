# Beginning of an experimental copy-and-patch like compiler backend written in Rust

This is supposed to become an experimental compiler backend based on [Copy and Patch](https://fredrikbk.com/publications/copy-and-patch.pdf) to be (maybe) later used in my OxidSQL Database for a compiling query engine. It might be the first copy and patch experiments (at least in a public repo) in Rust. I will try to use LLVM directly for generating the stencils instead of going through the kind of ugly C++ templates described in the original paper. The idea would be to use the existing codegen primitives in your database system that can already generate LLVM IR and use those to generate stencils. One could then also copy and patch these stencils together using those same primitives.

As a first step i will try to generate a few simple addition stencils and patch those together. As soon as that works, the hardest part should be done and it should just be a matter of adding more stencils and patching them together correctly (famous last words maybe).

## Current state

What currently works is generating a simple function using inkwell (adding a constant to a 64 bit integer passed as a function argument), reading the ELF file using goblin, patching in a simple constant for the addition and executing that. What's still missing is the actual part of patching together multiple stencils (and even having multiple stencils). This also means i still have to figure out how to do the tail call, stack and register stuff.
